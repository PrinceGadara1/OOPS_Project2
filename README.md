# 🎮 Tetris Game Project

Made using **C++** with **OOP Concepts**

## 📝 Description

This is a **classic Tetris Game** implemented in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts**. The game runs in the console and features **smooth gameplay**, **rotating Tetrominoes**, and an increasing difficulty level as you progress. 🧩✨

This project is designed to **demonstrate fundamental C++ programming concepts**, including **vectors, loops, object-oriented design, and real-time user input handling**. Players can control falling Tetrominoes using the **arrow keys** and aim for the **highest score** by clearing lines efficiently.

The project is modular and extendable, making it an excellent foundation for learning **game development in C++**. 🚀

## 🕹️ How the Game Works

1. **Tetrominoes** fall from the top and can be moved left, right, or rotated. 🔼◀️▶️🔽
2. A **valid move** ensures the piece does not overlap with existing blocks or go outside the grid.
3. Once a Tetromino **lands**, it becomes part of the board.
4. **Clearing a full row** removes it, awarding points and speeding up the game.
5. The game ends when the **Tetrominoes reach the top**. 🚧

---

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the compiled program.
2. Use the **Arrow Keys**:
   - `⬅️ Left Arrow`: Move Tetromino left.
   - `➡️ Right Arrow`: Move Tetromino right.
   - `⬆️ Up Arrow`: Rotate Tetromino.
   - `⬇️ Down Arrow`: Move Tetromino down faster.
3. **Clear lines** to increase your score.
4. The **game gets faster** as you progress! ⚡
5. The game ends when the blocks **stack up to the top**.
